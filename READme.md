# Scientific Calculator - SkillCraft Internship Project

## Project Description

This is a **Scientific Calculator** web application I built as part of my internship at **SkillCraft**.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations as well as scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, square root, powers, and parentheses for complex calculations.

## Tools Used

- **HTML** — for the webpage structure  
- **CSS** — for styling the calculator layout and buttons  
- **JavaScript** — for handling user inputs, calculations, and keyboard support

## How to Use

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code** or any code editor.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (you can use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code for live preview).
3. Use your mouse to click on buttons or use your keyboard to type inputs.
4. Press the `=` button or hit **Enter** to calculate the result.
5. Use the `C` button or **Escape** key to clear the display.
6. Use the backspace button (←) or **Backspace** key to delete the last input character.

| `(` and `)`       | Parentheses for grouping         | Use for complex expressions       |
| `sin(x)`          | Sine of angle x in degrees       | Angles are in degrees             |
| `cos(x)`          | Cosine of angle x in degrees     |                                  |
| `tan(x)`          | Tangent of angle x in degrees    |                                  |
| `log(x)`          | Base-10 logarithm                |                                  |
| `ln(x)`           | Natural logarithm (base e)       |                                  |
| `√(x)`            | Square root                     | Press `√` then enter the number   |
| `^`               | Power (exponentiation)            | Example: `2^3` = 8                |
| `.`               | Decimal point                   | For floating point numbers         |

## Notes

- Trigonometric functions use **degrees** (not radians).  
- The calculator handles errors gracefully — invalid expressions show `Error`.  
- Keyboard support allows typing numbers and operators directly for faster input.
